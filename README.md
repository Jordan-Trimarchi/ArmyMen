# ArmyMen

  This is a Companion App to a table-top strategy game I developed called Army Men Evolved.  
  The game can be played using standard Army Men bought from a dollar store.
  Instructions are available in the app by clicking "Rules" below the title.
  Use the left dropdown to select the unit you are currently using, this will display its stats.
  To attack a unit, select one from the right-hand dropdown, this will bring up the Attack Calculator.
  When dice rolls are necessary, you may either roll real dice and enter the values, or use the buttons in the app to generate rolls randomly.
  Barriers are indended to be square wooden blocks approx 2.5" X 2.5" X 0.5" but any props or household items can be used.
