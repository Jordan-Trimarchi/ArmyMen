# Army Men Evolved

  - This is a Companion App to a table-top strategy game I developed called Army Men Evolved.  <br />
  - Instructions are available in the app by clicking "Rules" below the title.<br />
  - The game can be played using standard Army Men bought from a dollar store.<br />
  - Use the left dropdown to select the unit you are currently using, this will display its stats.<br />
  - To attack a unit, select one from the right-hand dropdown, this will bring up the Attack Calculator.<br />
  - When dice rolls are necessary, you may either roll real dice and enter the values, or use the buttons in the app to generate rolls randomly.<br />
  - Barriers are indended to be square wooden blocks approx 2.5" X 2.5" X 0.5" but any props or household items can be used.<br />
